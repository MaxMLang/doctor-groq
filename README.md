## Why This Project Matters

Education is one of the most impactful sectors for the adoption of AI. AI-powered educational tools can offer personalized and accessible learning experiences, breaking down complex concepts in ways that are easy for children to understand. However, when designing AI applications for young audiences, **safety becomes paramount**.

Children are especially vulnerable to exposure to harmful or inappropriate content. Doctor Groq aims to bridge the gap between AI-driven educational resources and the need for strict content moderation. By integrating **Llama Guard 3 8B** for real-time content safety checks, Doctor Groq provides a safe environment for children to explore educational content. This project highlights how AI can contribute positively to education while safeguarding young users from inappropriate or harmful material.
